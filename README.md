How do I approach designing software?

I approach software design by first breaking the problem into smaller, manageable components. For this project, I focused on identifying the objects in the scene, how they related spatially, and what functionality each part needed before writing code. Planning the structure early helped prevent major redesigns later and made the project easier to manage as complexity increased.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project strengthened my ability to think visually and structurally at the same time. I learned how to design objects using simple geometric primitives and combine them to form more complex models. I also gained experience designing scenes with lighting, textures, and camera perspectives in mind rather than treating visuals as an afterthought.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

I followed an iterative design process. I started with basic shapes and layout, then gradually added textures, lighting, and camera controls. Each milestone allowed me to refine the scene based on testing and feedback, which helped ensure steady progress without overwhelming changes.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Breaking problems into smaller pieces and building incrementally can be applied to any software project. Whether working on graphics, systems programming, or application development, this approach helps reduce errors, improve clarity, and make debugging easier.

How do I approach developing programs?

I approach development by writing small, testable pieces of code and validating them before moving on. I focus on getting functionality working first, then refining performance, structure, and readability once the core behavior is correct.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I relied heavily on modular code and reuse. Creating helper functions and separating responsibilities between classes like SceneManager and ViewManager helped keep the code organized. I also learned to work more carefully with external libraries and assets such as textures and shaders.

How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration played a major role throughout the project. Many features such as lighting, texture placement, and camera movement required repeated adjustment and testing. Each iteration improved realism and usability while helping me better understand how OpenGL responds to changes.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones?

Over the milestones, my code became more structured and intentional. Early work focused on making things render correctly, while later stages emphasized cleaner organization, better naming, and more thoughtful design decisions. This progression led to a more polished final project.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science gives me problem-solving skills that apply across many fields. It teaches me how to analyze systems, think logically, and build solutions that scale, which supports both my academic and professional goals.

How do computational graphics and visualizations apply to my future education?

Computational graphics strengthened my understanding of math, transformations, and real-time systems. These skills will support future coursework in areas like game development, simulation, visualization, and performance-focused programming.

How do computational graphics and visualizations apply to my future profession?

Even outside of graphics-specific roles, the skills from this course are valuable. Understanding rendering pipelines, performance considerations, and visual problem solving can be applied to software engineering, simulation, UI development, and technical troubleshooting roles.
